## About me
My name is Ionela Vasiliu. I have started to take an interest in the software testing area. My goals are to improve and develop testing knowledge and technical skills, to reach the level of performance that I am capable of, in order to be a good tester. I would like to share my evolution in this field, starting from scratch.
## Skills
**Testing**
* can perform static amalysis on the UI
* can be a part of a review analysis 
* can perform functional testing on web applications
* gained hands-on experience by testing applications created for educational purposes
* can create test cases and execute them in a test management tool
* can create bug reports for the defects found and link them with the appropriate requirement
* can analyze efficiently functional documentation and point out the right questions to ensure that defects are found early
* can apply test design techniques, such as: boundary value analysis, equivalence paritioning, to derive test cases
* can make API requests in Postman- beginner level.
* can create database in MySQL- beginner level.

## Tools
* JIRA
* Zephyr for JIRA
* Postman for API
* My SQL

## Examples of my work
**Final Project for ITF MAnual and Automation Testing Course**
The final project consists in choosing a module from an application and start the testing process, based on bussiness requirements, from Test Planning until Test Completion, including SQL.

The test plan, test casess, bugs, test results, for the final project, can be found here: [Final Project-sportvision website](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Project-for-sportvision).

**Personal projects**:
* [Project for guru99 bank application](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/GURU99-BANKapp#final-project-for-itf-manual-testing-course-guru99-bank-application).
* [Project for orange hrm application](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Project-OrangeHRM#project-orangehrm).

**Exploratory testing on academybugs.com**

Performed exploratory testing on [Academy bugs](https://academybugs.com/). Found bugs were reported on JIRA: [bugs reports](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/academy.bugs.pdf).

**Postman for API**

My  learning activity on Postman can be found here:
* [Simple books](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/Simple%20Book%20API.postman_collection.json).
* [Contacts list](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/contact%20lists.postman_collection.json).
* [Spotify](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/Spotify.postman_collection.json).

**Test plan**

In order to better understand the scope of a test plan, I have tried to make drafts, as follows:
* [Test plan for Guru99Bank application-  the role of a Manager](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/testplanGuru99Bankapp.pdf).
* [Test plan for orange hrm application- the 'Job' module](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/testplanOrangeHRM.pdf).
