## About me
My name is Ionela Vasiliu. I have started to take an interest in the software testing area. My goals are to improve and develop testing knowledge and technical skills, to reach the level of performance that I am capable of, in order to be a good tester. I would like to share my evolution in this field, starting from scratch.
## Skills
**Testing**
* can perform functional testing on web applications
* gained hands-on experience by testing applications created for educational purposes
* can create test cases and execute them in a test management tool
* can create bug reports for the defects found and link them with the appropriate requirement
* can analyze efficiently functional documentation and point out the right questions to ensure that defects are found early
* can apply test design techniques such as boundary value analisys, equivalence paritioning to derive test cases

## Tools
* JIRA
* Zephyr for JIRA
