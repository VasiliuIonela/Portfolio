## About me
My name is Ionela Vasiliu. I have started to take an interest in the software testing area. My goals are to improve and develop testing knowledge and technical skills, to reach the level of performance that I am capable of, in order to be a good tester. I would like to share my evolution in this field, starting from scratch.
## Skills
**Testing**
* can perform functional testing on web applications
* gained hands-on experience by testing applications created for educational purposes
* can create test cases and execute them in a test management tool
* can create bug reports for the defects found and link them with the appropriate requirement
* can analyze efficiently functional documentation and point out the right questions to ensure that defects are found early
* can apply test design techniques such as boundary value analisys, equivalence paritioning to derive test cases

## Tools
* JIRA
* Zephyr for JIRA

## Examples of my work
**Final Project for ITF MAnual and Automation Testing Course**
The final project consists in choosing a module from an application and start the testing process, based on bussiness requirements, from Test Planning until Test Completion, including SQL.

The test plan, test casess, bugs, test results, for the final project, can be found here: [Final Project](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Final-Project-for-ITF-Manual-Testing-Course#final-project-for-itf-manual-testing-course-guru99-bank-application).

**Exploratory testing on academybugs.com**

Performed exploratory testing on [Academy bugs](https://academybugs.com/). Found bugs were reported on JIRA: [academybugs reports](https://guru99bankapp.atlassian.net/sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-fullcontent/temp/SearchRequest.html?jqlQuery=project+%3D+%22AC%22+ORDER+BY+created+DESC&atl_token=9504ab4b-3e51-4640-b024-1a2d74cd50ee_d5db600906e320fbb582bab70ca114ac24bdff84_lin&tempMax=1000).
