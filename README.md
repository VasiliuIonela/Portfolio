## About me
My name is Ionela Vasiliu. I have started to take an interest in the software testing area. My goals are to improve and develop testing knowledge and technical skills, to reach the level of performance that I am capable of, in order to be a good tester. I would like to share my evolution in this field, starting from scratch.
## Tech Skills
**Testing**
* Can take part of a review 
* Can perform functional testing on web applications
* Gained hands-on experience by testing applications created for educational purposes
* Can create test cases and execute them in a test management tool
* Can create bug reports for the defects found and link them with the appropriate requirement
* Can analyze efficiently functional documentation and point out the right questions to ensure that defects are found early
* Can apply test design techniques, such as: boundary value analysis, equivalence paritioning, to derive test cases
* Can make API requests in Postman- beginner level.
* Can create database in MySQL- beginner level.
* possess the knowledge required to utilize OOP concepts and techniques(Python and Java)->beginner level.

## Tools
* JIRA
* Zephyr for JIRA
* Postman for API
* My SQL 
* PyCharm for Python
* Selenium
* Intellij for Java

## Soft Skills
* Since I have started to explore Testing area, I have improved my analitic skills.
* I am ambitious, focused on my daily/weekly tasks.
* I pay attention to details(it is in my nature, a representative trait).
* Team work player.
* Punctual.
* As a hobby, I am an energic person, I like to train in the gym almost daily, I love walking.

## Examples of my work
**Final Project for ITF Manual and Automation Testing Course**
The final project consists in choosing a module from an application and start the testing process, based on bussiness requirements, from Test Planning until Test Completion, including SQL.

The test plan, test casess, bugs, test results, for the final project, can be found here: 
[Final Project-sportvision website](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Project-for-sportvision).

**Personal projects**: another project that I am working to:
* [Project for guru99 bank application](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/GURU99-BANKapp#final-project-for-itf-manual-testing-course-guru99-bank-application).
* [Project for orange hrm application](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Project-OrangeHRM#project-orangehrm).

**Exploratory testing on academybugs.com**

Performed exploratory testing on [Academy bugs](https://academybugs.com/). Found bugs were reported on JIRA: [bugs reports](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/academy.bugs.pdf).

**Postman for API**

My  learning activity on Postman can be found here:
* [Simple books](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/Simple%20Book%20API.postman_collection.json).
* [Contacts list](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/contact%20lists.postman_collection.json).
* [Spotify](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/Spotify.postman_collection.json).


**My SQL**

**Test plan**

In order to better understand the scope of a test plan, I have tried to make drafts, as follows:
* [Test plan for Guru99Bank application-  the role of a Manager](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/testplanGuru99Bankapp.pdf).
* [Test plan for orange hrm application- the 'Job' module](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Portfolio/blob/main/testplanOrangeHRM.pdf).

**Python vs Java**

My firsts stepts into these 2 programming languages were the actual comparison between them, and in order to better understand, I made some practice, including OOP, which can be found here:
* [Python learnings](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Python).
* [Java learninngs](https://github.com/VasiliuIonela/Java).

My knowledge, regarding this area, is expanding day by day. I am focused on gaining some real experience, in order to succeed and find a job where I can  reach my full potential and grow professionally.
